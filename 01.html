      <h1>Dwelling for Oil Traces 2024-2025</h1>
      <h2>Application - S+T+ARTS4WATER IIResidencies programme</h2>
      <h4><p>(speculative project #1)</p><p>“Dwelling for Oil Traces” aims to expose the accumulated hidden
        oil leakage in the Croation Rijeka harbour environment, focusing
        both on the hidden process of leakage itself and its broader
        impacts.</p>
        <p>This project will collect and map existing research media
        outcomes on this topic, explore the tactile properties of this
        media, and develop a graphic user interface prototype to make
        this media accessible to a non-specialist user. By linking the
        concept of forgotten spaces to artistic speculative methods and
        employing an OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) approach within the
        storytelling, the project will create an accessible and engaging
        artistic presentation of these neglected areas, involving users
        in an interactive narrative, installing new sustainable habits.
        The project aims to investigate why hidden leaks continue to
        occur and expose the mechanisms behind them to a wide audience. To
        demonstrate how these seemingly minor, habitual leaks accumulate
        over time into a significant environmental issue. And to install
        sustainable habits of awareness: dwellings.</p></h4>

          <h3><p>Facts</p></h3>
            
            <h4><p>Jellyfish, often seen as mere drifters of the ocean, have shown remarkable resilience in oil-affected areas. Their unique ability to produce mucus under stress, rich in nitrogen and oil-degrading bacteria, enables them to break down oil spills effectively. This natural process accelerates the degradation of oil, mitigating its harmful impacts on marine environments.
              However, the introduction of chemical dispersants does poses a significant threat to jellyfish, altering their color, shape, and even causing death.
              Intrigued by their natural prowess, scientists are now exploring synthetic biology to replicate this phenomenon. The goal is to develop non-invasive, biodegradable synthetic organisms that mimic jellyfish to detect and eliminate toxins, ensuring the protection of marine life. This innovative approach holds promise for large-scale applications, potentially transforming how we address marine oil pollution.</h4>

               <h4>| Oil Absorption Veil: The mask's jellyfish-like tentacles actively absorb and break down oil particles in the water, using advanced bio-mimicry technology to convert pollutants into harmless substances.
                | Mucus Mist Shield: Emits a protective mist of synthetic jellyfish mucus that neutralizes toxins on contact, creating a safe bubble for the wearer and purifying the surrounding water.
                | Bioluminescent Alerts: The mask glows in different colors to indicate the presence of various pollutants, providing real-time feedback on water quality and alerting the user to potential hazards.
                | Eco-Communication Network: Connects with other masks to form a network, allowing users to share data and coordinate clean-up efforts. The masks communicate through bioluminescent pulses and underwater sound waves.
                | Adaptive Camouflage: Changes color and texture to blend with the environment, protecting the wearer from potential threats and allowing for covert operations in polluted areas.</p></h4>
