                <h4><p>"Der Doppelg채nger" is a novella written by Fyodor Dostoevsky and was published in 1846. The novella deals with themes such as identity and alienation. It reflects on the individual's struggle for recognition and meaning in a society that often marginalizes and neglects them. It's a classic work of literature that has been analyzed for its exploration of psychological and existential themes. Just as the protagonist, Yakov Golyadkin, grapples with the existence of his doppelg채nger and questions his own identity, my concept involves the creation of digital avatars based on ones biometric data. Players explore their identity through reflecting their own data, they reflect on a parallel, digital version of themselves through colours and shapes. "Der Doppelg채nger" highlights Golyadkin's alienation in a society that overlooks him. In a world of increasing data collection and surveillance, individuals often feel alienated from their own data. My project bridges this gap by making players active agents in shaping their digital avatars, potentially reducing feelings of alienation. Just as Dostoevsky's novella explores psychological and existential awareness of its protagonist, my project encourages players to explore the deeper meanings of their own data, bridging the gap between the digital and the personal.</p>
